apg-go is a simple APG-like password generator written in Go.

It tries to replicate the functionality of the "Automated Password Generator",
which hasn't been maintained since 2003. Since more and more Unix distributions
are abondoning the tool, I was looking for an alternative. FreeBSD for example
recommends "security/makepasswd", which is written in Perl but requires a lot
of dependency packages and doesn't offer the feature-set/flexibility of APG.

Since FIPS-181 (pronouncable passwords) has been withdrawn in 2015, there is
no use in replicating that feature. Therfore apg-go does not support
pronouncable passwords.
